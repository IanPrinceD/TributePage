   Was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential
   physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important
   contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together
   the two pillars of modern physics. His massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc<sup>2</sup>, which arises from
   relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on
   the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and
   especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum
   theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".
